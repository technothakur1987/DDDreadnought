There is one index,html which can be consisdered as the main page and 
then with five additional pages for each section of the profile page 

little bit of js is used to add some eventlisteners ,, this dashboard can be easily made 
using reactjs library also but i prefrerred bootstrap5 with a single page for every 
option (edit profile ,mamange subscription etc)because I saw u r original dashboard 
is also using bootstrap framework .favicon and images are copied from the original refrence 
website of dreadnought..

if detailed outline of the layout for dashboard was given , we could have designed 
according to the requirement..
